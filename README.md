It is a real time online multiplayer html5 web game.
All the visual magic happens here.
The keystrokes and cursor movement, angle data is sent to the server where every player's data is synchronized.
Then after a certain window of time, the game data is recieved by the clients which they update on the screen.

Currently it's not active, but i plan to put it again on a server again. Anyway feel free to have a look at the code, there are a lot of cool things like data interpolation, custom GUI components etc..
